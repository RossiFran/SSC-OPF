# Small-signal Constrained Optimal Power Flow (SSC-OPF)
This repository contains codes for developing an optimal power flow with regression-based small-signal stability constraints.

## Data
This repository includes the scripts used for case studies and is organized as follows:
* GD-driven folder: a folder containing the scripts for implementing the SSC-OPF based on the generation dispatch (GD).
* GDCT-driven folder: a folder containing the scripts for implementing the SSC-OPF based on the GD and converters controllers parameters tuning (CT).

In each folder, the scripts are organized following the steps presented in Section III. Methodology of the paper and shown in the figure.
